1) runscan produces hmm scan files for each .faa file

2) orthlists uses these to produce lists of orthologous proteins, using one representative from each group as a comparator

2b) run dbs on representatives from each group

3) parse results produces a score table for each gene in the ortholog list for each isolate

4) resultstable produces results tables for each of the niche comparisons

** Paul pointed out that a zero may mean failure to sequence a gene, rather than absence of the gene from the genome, so we are going for NA values rather than zeros
